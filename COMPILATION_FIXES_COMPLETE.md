# Recipe Builder & Library System - Critical Fixes Applied

## 🔧 **CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED**

### ✅ **LATEST FIX: Syntax Error in IngredientsViewModel**
**Problem**: Compilation failing with "Expecting member declaration" and "Missing }" errors
**Solution**: Added missing closing brace for class declaration

**Details**:
- **Root Cause**: `IngredientsViewModel.kt` was missing the closing `}` for the class declaration
- **Location**: Line 146 in `app/src/main/java/com/brewingtracker/presentation/viewmodel/IngredientsViewModel.kt`
- **Error**: Class declaration started but never properly closed
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - ✅ Added missing closing brace `}` at end of class
  - ✅ Proper class structure now complete
  - ✅ All syntax errors resolved

**Files Changed**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/brewingtracker/presentation/viewmodel/IngredientsViewModel.kt` (FIXED)

**Compilation Status**: ✅ FIXED - No more syntax errors

---

### ✅ **PREVIOUS FIX: Duplicate Class Resolution**
**Problem**: Compilation failing with "Redeclaration" errors for RecipeLibraryViewModel
**Solution**: Removed duplicate class file and fixed package structure

**Details**:
- **Root Cause**: Two identical `RecipeLibraryViewModel.kt` files existed in different directories:
  - `app/src/main/java/com/brewingtracker/presentation/viewmodel/RecipeLibraryViewModel.kt` (DUPLICATE)
  - `app/src/main/java/com/brewingtracker/presentation/screens/recipe/RecipeLibraryViewModel.kt` (CORRECT)
- **Both files**: Had same package declaration causing "Redeclaration" compilation errors
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - ✅ Removed duplicate from viewmodel directory
  - ✅ Enhanced the correct file with combined functionality
  - ✅ Fixed all package declarations and imports
  - ✅ Merged best features from both implementations

**Files Changed**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/brewingtracker/presentation/screens/recipe/RecipeLibraryViewModel.kt` (UPDATED)
- `app/src/main/java/com/brewingtracker/presentation/viewmodel/RecipeLibraryViewModel.kt` (REMOVED)

**Compilation Status**: ✅ FIXED - No more redeclaration errors
