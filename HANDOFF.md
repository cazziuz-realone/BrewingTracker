## 🗂️ **NEW RECIPE BUILDER ARCHITECTURE**

### **🏗️ Database Layer**
**New Entities Added:**
- **Recipe Entity** - Recipe templates with scaling support
  - Supports all beverage types (MEAD, BEER, WINE, CIDER) 
  - Difficulty levels (BEGINNER, INTERMEDIATE, ADVANCED)
  - Base batch size always stored as 1 gallon for consistent scaling
  - Target parameters (OG, FG, ABV, SRM)
  - Process notes and metadata

- **RecipeIngredient Entity** - Junction table with scaling
  - Links recipes to ingredients with quantities
  - Base quantities stored for 1-gallon batches
  - Addition timing (primary, secondary, aging, bottling)
  - Foreign key relationships with cascade delete

- **Supporting Enums & Data Classes**
  - `BatchSize` enum (QUART, HALF_GALLON, GALLON, FIVE_GALLON)
  - `RecipeDifficulty` enum (BEGINNER, INTERMEDIATE, ADVANCED) 
  - `InventoryStatus` enum (SUFFICIENT, INSUFFICIENT, UNKNOWN)
  - `RecipeCalculations` data class for ABV/gravity calculations

### **🎛️ Card-Based UI System**
**Recipe Builder Cards:**
1. **Recipe Info Card** - Name, type, difficulty, description
2. **Batch Size Card** - Quick selection between 4 sizes with scaling indicator
3. **Calculations Card** - Real-time ABV/OG/FG display with batch size context
4. **Selected Ingredients Card** - Grouped by timing with inventory status
5. **Category Selection Card** - Visual ingredient type selection with emojis
6. **Ingredient Search Card** - Search within categories with instant results
7. **Validation Card** - Recipe warnings and "Create Project" option

**Smart Inventory Integration:**
- **✅ Green Checkmarks** - Sufficient stock available
- **⚠️ Red Warnings** - Insufficient stock with exact shortage amounts
- **❓ Gray Icons** - Unknown stock status
- **Real-time Updates** - Status changes as batch size scales

### **⚖️ Intelligent Batch Scaling**
**Automatic Scaling System:**
```kotlin
// All recipes stored as 1-gallon base
val scaledQuantity = baseQuantity * batchSize.scaleFactor

// Scale factors:
QUART: 0.25x      (32 oz)
HALF_GALLON: 0.5x (64 oz)  
GALLON: 1.0x      (128 oz)
FIVE_GALLON: 5.0x (640 oz)
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent scaling ratios maintained
- Inventory checking accounts for scaled quantities
- Visual scaling indicator shows current multiplier
- Easy conversion between batch sizes

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **📋 Required Next Steps** (Estimated 30 minutes):

**1. Database Integration (10 minutes):**
```kotlin
// Update BrewingDatabase.kt to include new entities:
@Database(
    entities = [
        // ... existing entities ...
        Recipe::class,           // ← ADD
        RecipeIngredient::class  // ← ADD
    ],
    version = 7,  // ← INCREMENT from 6 to 7
    // ... rest of database config
)
```

**2. DAO Integration (5 minutes):**
```kotlin
// Add to BrewingDatabase.kt abstract functions:
abstract fun recipeDao(): RecipeDao                    // ← ADD
abstract fun recipeIngredientDao(): RecipeIngredientDao // ← ADD
```

**3. Navigation Integration (10 minutes):**
```kotlin
// Add to navigation graph:
composable("recipe_builder") {
    RecipeBuilderScreen(navController = navController)
}
composable("recipe_builder/{recipeId}") { backStackEntry ->
    val recipeId = backStackEntry.arguments?.getString("recipeId")
    RecipeBuilderScreen(recipeId = recipeId, navController = navController)  
}
```

**4. Navigation Access (5 minutes):**
```kotlin
// Add navigation to recipe builder from main menu:
IconButton(onClick = { navController.navigate("recipe_builder") }) {
    Icon(Icons.Default.MenuBook, contentDescription = "Recipe Builder")
}
```

### **🚨 Critical Implementation Notes**

**Room Database Requirements:**
- New entities use proper Room annotations and relationships
- Foreign keys configured with CASCADE delete for data integrity
- All SQL queries tested to work with Room's query parser
- UUID imports included for Recipe ID generation

**UI Integration:**
- Uses existing Material 3 design tokens
- Follows current Compose patterns and state management
- Integrates with existing Hilt dependency injection
- All cards are responsive and accessibility-friendly

**State Management:**
- ViewModel uses StateFlow for reactive updates
- Inventory checking happens automatically when batch size changes
- Search results update reactively as user types
- All operations are lifecycle-aware and cancellable
