## 🔧 **RESOLVED TECHNICAL ISSUES**

### **✅ Critical Database Issues (Completely Fixed)**

#### **1. Database Population (✅ Resolved)**
```kotlin
// Issue: Only 15 ingredients showing instead of 150+
// Solution: Fixed database version and population logic
@Database(
    entities = [/* all entities */],
    version = 9,  // ✅ INCREMENTED to force recreation
    exportSchema = false
)

override fun onOpen(db: SupportSQLiteDatabase) {
    val count = ingredientDao.getIngredientCount()
    if (count < 150) {  // ✅ FIXED: Changed from 100 to 150
        println("BrewingDatabase: Repopulating with 150+ ingredients...")
        populateDatabase(database)
    }
}

Status: ✅ 150+ ingredients load reliably on every app launch
```

#### **2. Foreign Key Constraint Violations (✅ Resolved)**
```kotlin
// Issue: "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed" when adding ingredients
// Solution: Always ensure recipe exists before adding ingredients
fun addIngredient(ingredient: Ingredient) {
    // ✅ CRITICAL FIX: Save recipe to database first
    val savedRecipeId = if (_uiState.value.isEditing) {
        recipeDao.updateRecipe(currentRecipe)
        currentRecipe.id
    } else {
        recipeDao.insertRecipe(currentRecipe)  // Save recipe FIRST
        _uiState.value = _uiState.value.copy(isEditing = true)
        currentRecipe.id
    }
    
    // ✅ NOW safely add ingredient with valid foreign key
    val recipeIngredient = RecipeIngredient(
        recipeId = savedRecipeId,  // Valid foreign key
        ingredientId = ingredient.id,
        // ... other fields
    )
    recipeIngredientDao.insertRecipeIngredient(recipeIngredient)
}

Status: ✅ Ingredients add successfully without database errors
```

### **✅ UI/UX Issues (Completely Fixed)**

#### **1. Batch Size Button Layout (✅ Resolved)**
```kotlin
// Issue: Inconsistent button sizing and poor layout
// Solution: Fixed height and better text layout
Row(
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
    horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(6.dp)
) {
    BatchSize.values().forEach { size ->
        FilterChip(
            onClick = { onSizeChange(size) },
            label = { 
                Column(horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally) {
                    Text(text = when (size) {
                        BatchSize.QUART -> "Quart"
                        BatchSize.HALF_GALLON -> "½ Gal"  // ✅ Better fit
                        BatchSize.GALLON -> "1 Gal"
                        BatchSize.FIVE_GALLON -> "5 Gal"
                    })
                    Text(text = "${size.ozValue} oz")
                }
            },
            selected = currentSize == size,
            modifier = Modifier
                .weight(1f)
                .height(56.dp)  // ✅ Fixed height for consistency
        )
